## EARS Expression

### Normative behavior

The `okfkb` capability SHALL enable engineering teams to capture, organize, and
mature knowledge while retaining the evidence and provenance on which that
knowledge depends.

### Preserved stakeholder intent

## User Need

Engineering teams need to turn observations into reusable understanding without
losing the original findings, confusing hypotheses with established knowledge,
or allowing automated maintenance to silently replace human judgment.

### Rationale and constraints

- Raw findings remain immutable evidence; maturation creates or updates the
  appropriate higher knowledge layer.
- Promotion or consolidation decisions that require judgment remain explicit and
  reviewable by a human.
